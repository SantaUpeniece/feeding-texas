Theresa is currently working out of the Houston Food Bank, investigating the barriers faced by specific populations to help better serve all Texans. Not a native Houstonian, Theresa moved around enough that she doesn't really know where she's from. Previously, she served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia as a Community Health Educator, where she drank lots of local coffee. Theresa attended Stephen F. Austin State University for her bachelorâ€™s and earned her Master of Public Health from Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.
