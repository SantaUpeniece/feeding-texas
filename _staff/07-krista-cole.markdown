Krista works to ensure that each of our twenty-one food banks have access to varied produce. Krista works in food insecurity because she believes sustainable agriculture and management of food systems leads to an improved quality of life for clients through supporting nutritious diverse diets. During her time in the Peace Corps Krista observed the impact that food systems had on poverty in Panama.  Relating to the hungry and working on a vegetable farm in Pennsylvania led to her interest in pursuing her degree in agriculture. Krista received her Masters of Science in Agriculture from Washington State University and her Bachelors of Science in Biology from Texas A&M University.
