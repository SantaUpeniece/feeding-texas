Elizabeth Rhymer assists the Feeding Texas produce team by analyzing distribution metrics and coordinating distribution in order to better meet the needs of the statewide network of food banks. For Elizabeth supplying produce access to food bank clients is meaningful work, in part, because her passion for fresh fruit and vegetables started when she was young, growing up on her family’s farm. Prior to Feeding Texas Elizabeth served with the United States Army in distribution and logistics management roles. Elizabeth holds a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Truman State University.
