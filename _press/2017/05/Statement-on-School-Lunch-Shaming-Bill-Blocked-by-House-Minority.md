*Statement attributable to Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas:*

“Yesterday, petty politics prevailed over a bipartisan consensus in the Texas legislature to help hungry kids. Led by Representative Jonathan Stickland, five House Representatives blocked HB 2159, a bill that could have ended school lunch shaming in Texas by creating commonsense standards to protect the dignity and well-being of hungry schoolchildren.

“This procedural equivalent of a 'drive-by shooting' was the opposite of the reasoned, compassionate debate we expect of our elected leaders, especially when it comes to the welfare of our littlest Texans. 
 
“We applaud the passion that bill author Representative Helen Giddings demonstrated in [her response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWeA1g5AygI) to this shameful move. We urge all members of the Legislature to stand with Representative Giddings to protect the rights and welfare of young children.”
