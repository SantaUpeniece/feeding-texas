Austin, TX – Feeding Texas staff joined other partners in the underground State Operations Center this week following Governor Greg Abbott’s declaration of a [severe weather activation](http://gov.texas.gov/news/press-release/20854) across Texas.

Due to thunderstorms and tornadoes, Governor Abbott [declared](http://gov.texas.gov/news/proclamation/20862) a state of disaster in Bosque, Clay, Denton, Eastland, Gaines, Montague and Van Zandt counties. The severe weather is expected to impact the eastern half of the state over the next five days, particularly in areas prone to flooding.   

Feeding Texas coordinates the efforts of twenty-one regional food banks to respond to disasters, and is an official nonprofit partner in the state’s emergency management plan. During disasters, Feeding Texas staff join state agencies and charities active in the state’s Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) group to provide timely information to service providers and state officials.

Food banks play an important, local role during disasters by providing emergency food  and water to feeding centers operated by VOAD partners including the American Red Cross and Salvation Army.

Monetary donations can be processed more quickly and efficiently than canned food or other goods during an emergency. Concerned Texans are urged to donate to relief efforts in two ways:

* Monetary donations can be made [directly to Feeding Texas](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/feeding-texas).
* Monetary donations can be made to [your local food bank](http://www.feedingtexas.org/help/).

Feeding Texas leads a unified effort for a hunger-free Texas.
