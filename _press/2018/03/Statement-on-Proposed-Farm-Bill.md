*Statement attributable to Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas:*

“In a wealthy nation like the U.S., it may be hard to imagine that anyone, much less our Texas neighbors go hungry. But hunger affects people in every state and county. 

“SNAP is our nation’s commitment to help people when they struggle to afford food. SNAP primarily helps feed children, the elderly and the disabled, but it also boosts the earnings of hard-working adults struggling to escape poverty. 

“Many SNAP recipients struggle to find work in a fast-changing economy that isn't creating enough good jobs. SNAP can’t make up for the shortfalls in our job market, but it  can be strengthened to help people succeed in the workforce.

“Regretfully and despite the best intentions, this Farm Bill will make it harder, not easier for struggling families to succeed. 

“Hunger never helped anyone find a job. This Farm Bill would increase hunger by cutting food aid to adults who can’t find work despite their best efforts. By imposing arbitrary time limits and other cookie-cutter solutions, this Farm Bill ignores local economic conditions and the challenges that low-wage workers face in today’s economy. 

“Cutting programs that help families meet basic needs is never a responsible approach to helping them succeed, or meeting our nation's financial challenges. 

“That's why we urge Congress to go back to the drawing board and present reasonable, bipartisan solutions that will help more hard-working Americans avoid hunger and achieve financial security.”
