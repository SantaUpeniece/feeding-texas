Austin – Texas hunters and fisherman will encounter a new opportunity to donate money to Hunters for the Hungry when purchasing or renewing their licenses this year. Their donation will support a popular program that provides thousands of servings of venison annually to struggling Texans.
 
“Hunters for the Hungry brings healthy protein to struggling families while encouraging environmental stewardship,” said Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, which sponsors the program. “It’s a win-win for hunters, landowners, processors and Texans who are struggling to make ends meet.”
 
The program, which is a partnership between Feeding Texas, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and local meat processors, offers hunters the opportunity to donate excess deer meat to needy families in their community. The meat is distributed through a statewide network of regional food banks via local charities.

The new donation option resulted from legislation passed by the Texas Legislature in 2015. Roughly 2.6 million licenses are sold in Texas annually.

"We encourage all hunters and fishermen who want to give to their community to make a donation when they apply for a license this year,” said Cole. 

Contributions from hunting licenses will allow Feeding Texas to expand the program. Hunters who want to donate meat must bring either a white tail or mule deer to a participating meat processor, pay a discounted processing fee and receive a tax-deductible receipt for their donation. The processor grinds and packages the meat for distribution by a local food bank. The program has operated in Texas for over twenty years and has been managed by Feeding Texas since 2012.
