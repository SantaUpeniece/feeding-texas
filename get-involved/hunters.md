Help us fight hunger and promote environmental stewardship! 

Hunters for the Hungry provides over nine million servings of venison annually to Texans in need. Through the program, hunters can donate legally tagged, field-dressed deer at [participating meat processors](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.feedingtexas.org/pdf/Hunters-for-the-Hungry-Processors.pdf). The processors prepare the venison for distribution to local hunger relief agencies like food banks and food pantries. Here's how you can help:    

**Hunters**    
> Bring your legally tagged, field-dressed white tail or mule deer to a [participating meat processor](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.feedingtexas.org/pdf/Hunters-for-the-Hungry-Processors.pdf). There will be a nominal processing fee (~$40) to compensate the processor for their labor. You will receive a receipt for your donation, which may be tax-deductible. If your local processor is not a participant, ask them to sign up!

**Meat Processors**    
> To become a participating processor, please request a participation agreement from ssykes@feedingtexas.org. Prior to each hunting season, participating processors will receive donation receipts, two-pound chub packs for donated venison and promotional materials. Processors must provide evidence of a health inspection or fall under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of State Health Services to be eligible.

**Hunger Relief Agencies**    
> Food banks, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other hunger relief agencies are eligible to receive venison donations. Contact ssykes@feedingtexas.org to be added to the list of recipient agencies. Hunters for the Hungry does not directly determine recipients (that is up to the individual meat processor), but we do provide lists of nearby participating agencies.
