Help us provide healthy protein to Texans in need while promoting environmental stewardship! 

Hunters for the Hungry coordinates Texas hunters, meat processors and hunger relief agencies to provide over nine million servings of lean venison annually to hungry families. Through the program, hunters can donate legally tagged, field-dressed deer at [participating meat processors](list). For a nominal fee, the processor will prepare and package the venison for distribution through local hunger relief agencies such as food banks and food pantries.

**How you can help:**    

**Hunters**    
Bring your legally tagged, field-dressed white tail or mule deer to a [participating meat processor](list). There will be a nominal processing fee (~$40) to compensate the processor for their labor. You will receive a receipt for your donation, which may be tax-deductible (consult your tax advisor). If your local meat processor is not a Hunters for the Hungry participant, ask them to sign up!

**Meat Processors**    
To become a participating processor, please request a participation agreement from hfth@feedingtexas.org. Prior to each hunting season, participating processors will receive donation receipts, two-pound chub packs for donated venison and promotional materials. Processors must provide evidence of a health inspection or fall under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of State Health Services to be eligible.

**Hunger Relief Agencies**    
Food banks, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other hunger relief agenciesare eligible to receive venison donations. Contact hfth@feedingtexas.org to be added to the list of recipient agencies. Hunters for the Hungry does not directly determine recipients (that is up to the individual meat processor), but we do provide lists of nearby participating agencies.
