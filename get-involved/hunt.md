Help us fight hunger and promote environmental stewardship! 

Hunters for the Hungry has provided over nine million servings of venison to Texans in need. Through the program, hunters can donate legally tagged, field-dressed deer at [participating meat processors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LVAjjSS53TbW8Mxwr1V3CNnr_n8MiCnewe7ZrLfmDdM/edit#gid=777320987). The processors prepare the venison for distribution to local hunger relief agencies like food banks and food pantries. Here's how you can help:    

**Hunters**    
> Bring your legally tagged, field-dressed white tail or mule deer to a [participating meat processor](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LVAjjSS53TbW8Mxwr1V3CNnr_n8MiCnewe7ZrLfmDdM/edit#gid=777320987).

> [You can also donate to support processing fees!](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/huntersforthehungry) 

**Meat Processors**    
> To become a participating processor, contact [your local food bank](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.feedingtexas.org/pdf/H4H-food-bank-contact-list.pdf) to sign up. Once registered, you will be advertised on this website. Prior to each hunting season, participating processors will receive donation receipts, two-pound chub packs for donated venison and promotional materials. 

**Hunger Relief Agencies**    
> Food banks, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other hunger relief agencies are eligible to receive venison donations. Contact [your local food bank](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.feedingtexas.org/pdf/H4H-food-bank-contact-list.pdf) to be added to the list of recipient agencies.
