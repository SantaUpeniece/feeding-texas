Most people have noticed the rising price of groceries in recent years. These costs hit low-income Texans particularly hard, especially in their struggle to afford fresh, lean protein.

 Not coincidentally, protein is also one of the most requested food groups at Texas food pantries, [according to our research](http://www.feedingtexas.org/product/2014/11/01-Hunger-In-America-2014-Texas-Report/). 

[Hunters for the Hungry](http://www.feedingtexas.org/get-involved/hunt/) is our popular program for bringing lean protein to the plates of hungry Texans. Hunters have donated over nine million servings of venison through this partnership between Texas Parks and Wildlife, Feeding Texas food banks and local meat processors.

This year, there’s a new way for hunters to support our work – and you don’t even have to be a good shot!

When Texas hunting licenses go on sale August 15th, they will include a simple checkbox to donate to Hunters for the Hungry. Your donations will allow Feeding Texas to expand the program in more communities and bring more healthy food to local families.

With over two million hunting licenses sold annually in Texas, even a small gift from hunters throughout the state could make a big difference in the lives of food insecure Texans. Spread the word!
