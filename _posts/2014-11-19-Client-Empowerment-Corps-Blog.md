At Feeding Texas, we’re always looking for new, innovative ways to help our member food banks build their capacity to decrease food insecurity.

That’s why we created the Client Empowerment Corps, a statewide VISTA project to address the upstream causes and downstream effects of food insecurity through new, non-traditional partnerships. We know hunger is about more than food, which is why these partnerships will be aimed at increasing access to health resources and economic opportunities for struggling families, as well as helping them add their voices to the public discussion on hunger.

So far, our VISTA members have been conducting local assessments to determine the biggest health and economic needs in their communities, as well as how to best address those problems through partnerships. Ultimately, they will be creating partnerships with local organizations who are experts in these fields in order to provide access to resources that meet the broader needs of food bank clients. 

As a VISTA Leader, my role is to help our team complete their assessments and identify promising partnerships that will make their communities healthier and more food secure.  I will be working to ensure each VISTA term runs smoothly, help the VISTAs develop their professional skills, and foster communication between the VISTAs in order to share best practices.  

From launching nutrition education internships to providing health resources at farmer’s markets and pantries, our VISTAs have already begun creating exciting projects and partnerships. We plan to chronicle their success in blog posts to come - stay tuned here, or join our [mailing list](http://www.feedingtexas.org/news/sign-up/) to follow their progress!
