Feeding Texas strengthens the work of our twenty-one member food banks by spreading best practices and industry expertise throughout our network. We intend to keep improving until hunger is behind us.

We are fortunate to have friends in this effort like Profit Point, a respected supply chain management company. Ted Schaefer and his colleagues at Profit Point are helping us understand and adopt current best practices to deliver more fresh produce at a lower cost to families in need.  

Read [Profit Pointâ€™s blog](http://www.profitpt.com/distribution/apple-day/) about the genesis of this project and what's going to happen next.
