Last week, the team here at Feeding Texas had the opportunity to spend a day volunteering for a product recovery shift at the brand new Central Texas Food Bank in Austin. Our 15 staff members sorted through pallets of donated food, packaged, boxed and stored the recovered food items. All of our hard work helped provide 7,125 meals for hungry families here in Central Texas!

The new Central Texas Food Bank is located at 6500 Metropolis Dr. and is over twice the size of their old facility. The larger facility offers two and a half times the amount of dry storage capacity and seven times the amount of cold storage space.
The Central Texas Food Bankâ€™s volunteer capacity increased with the move into the new building too. They can now accommodate up to 120 volunteers per shift between two Product Recovery sorting spaces.
