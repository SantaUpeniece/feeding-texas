In the food banking world, we are fortunate to have friends like Profit Point, a supply chain management company that is helping our 21 member food banks to deliver more fresh produce at a lower cost. Our food banks strive to be good stewards of the resources entrusted to us, and we are grateful to Ted Schaefer and his colleagues at Profit Point for helping us understand and adopt current best practices in supply chain management to achieve this goal.  

Follow this [link](http://www.profitpt.com/news/) to Profit Pointâ€™s blog about the genesis of the project and next steps.
