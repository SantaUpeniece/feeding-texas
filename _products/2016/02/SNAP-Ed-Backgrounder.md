In FY2016, Feeding Texas food banks partnered with the state to invest a total of $7.5M in strategies to widen opportunities for low-income families to make healthy choices where they live, learn, shop, and play. 

With this money, our food banks are “feeding with impact” – pairing healthy food distribution with evidence-based obesity prevention programs.
