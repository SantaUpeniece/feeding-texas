In 2015, Feeding Texas and our network of 21 food banks provided services to over 3.5 million Texans. 

We worked to  “Feed for Today, Strengthen for Tomorrow, and Empower for Life” through healthy food sourcing and distribution, connecting our clients to public services, and empowering them to seek other skill-building and health services to break the cycle of food and economic insecurity that leads to hunger.
