Feeding with Impact is a statewide, public-private partnership to curb the costs of obesity and improve dietary health by pairing the distribution of free produce with evidence-based health interventions in low-income Texas communities.  

Feeding Texas seeks $22 million from the 85th Texas Legislature to support a new centralized, optimized distribution system that will dramatically increase the scope and impact of this partnership.
